Let’s get you all get started with projects that cover a range of machine learning tasks and complexity levels, from basics. Start with a project that matches your interests and gradually work your way up to more challenging tasks as you gain experience. Feel free to ask your queries and more importantly, learn with us.
	PROJECTS:
A.	Titanic Dataset Cleaning [Beginner]:
Use pandas framework to read the famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle and apply preprocessing techniques using Numpy to fill null values in dataset. Create a new dataset as csv with most relevant features for model training.
Dataset link: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle

B.	Salary Dataset visualization [Beginner]:
Use matplotlib to visualize data and plot all curves corresponding to features after preprocessing and normalizing the dataset. Use innovative style approaches to make the data appealing and informative.
Dataset: Salary Prediction Classification (kaggle.com)

C.	Housing Price Prediction [Intermediate]:
Use linear regression machine learning model to train your model aimed to achieve great accuracy scores. You need to preform following steps while training:
	Data Preprocessing
	Feature Extraction and Engineering
	Data Normalization
	Model Training (Linear Regression)
	Making predictions
Dataset: California House Price (kaggle.com)
