## Welcome to 1st Month project, guys ðŸ‘‹
Letâ€™s get you all get started with projects that cover a range of machine learning tasks and complexity levels, from basics. Start with a project that matches your interests and gradually work your way up to more challenging tasks as you gain experience. Feel free to ask your queries and more importantly, learn with us.

		<br><br>
		<ul>	
			<li>
				Preform data preprocessing and cleaning to obtain tuned dataset	
			</li>
			<li>
				Use seaborn / matplotlib to visualize dataset in form of plots and curves <br>
				<u>Example:</u> Histplots, Pairplots, scatterplots etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use innovative style approaches to make the data appealing and informative.

				Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
			</li>
			<li>
				Feature Extraction and Engineering [Using relevant features]
			</li>
			<li>
				Data Visualization 
			</li>
			<li>
				Splitting dataset into training and testing datasets
			</li>
			<li>
				Model Training (Linear Regression)
			</li>
			<li>
				Making predictions and evaluating performance
