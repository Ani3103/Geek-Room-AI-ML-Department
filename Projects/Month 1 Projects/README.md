## Welcome to 1st Month projects, guys ðŸ‘‹
Letâ€™s get you all get started with projects that cover a range of machine learning tasks and complexity levels, from basics. Start with a project that matches your interests and gradually work your way up to more challenging tasks as you gain experience. Feel free to ask your queries and more importantly, learn with us.

* <b><i>Atleast 1 of the 2 projects to be completed and the corresponding jupyter file to be uploaded as a team</i></b>\

# Task:
Make a folder in "Month 1 Projects" with the name of your team [your choice of name] and add a README.md mentioning your names. Then, push your code files in the same folder.

		<ul>	
			<li>
				Preform data preprocessing and cleaning to obtain tuned dataset	
			</li>
			<li>
				Use seaborn / matplotlib to visualize dataset in form of plots and curves <br>
				<u>Example:</u> Histplots, Pairplots, scatterplots etc.
